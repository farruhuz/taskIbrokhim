**Task 1: Build a Simple Web Application**

**Description:** Create a simple web application that allows users to browse and filter a list of items. The application should fetch data from a mock API and display it dynamically on the page. Users should be able to filter the items based on certain criteria.

**Requirements:**

1. Use a framework like React (optional Next) or Vue.js (optional Nuxt).
1. Fetch data from a mock API.
1. Display the fetched data in a visually appealing way, such as a grid or list view.
1. Implement filtering functionality based on at least one criteria (e.g., category, price range).
1. Ensure responsive design.
1. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the list of items.
1. Add sorting functionality based on different attributes (e.g., alphabetical order, price).

**Task 2: Implement a Complex Form with Validation and Conditional Logic**

**Description:** Develop a standalone form component with advanced features to handle user input effectively. The form should include various types of fields and implement validation for each field. Additionally, incorporate conditional logic to dynamically adjust the form based on user selections.

**Requirements:**

1. **Fields Variety**: Include a mix of different input types such as text inputs, dropdown menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, and text areas.
1. **Validation**: Implement client-side validation for each form field. Ensure that appropriate validation messages are displayed when the input is invalid. Validation rules should cover common scenarios such as required fields, minimum and maximum length, format validation for email addresses, and numeric inputs.
1. **Conditional Logic**: Introduce conditional logic to the form. For instance, if a user selects a specific option from a dropdown, additional input fields related to that option should dynamically appear. Conversely, if the user selects another option, those fields should disappear or become disabled.
1. **Submission Handling**: Validate the entire form on submission. If any field fails validation, prevent the form from submitting and display error messages next to the invalid fields. If all fields pass validation, simulate form submission by logging the form data to the console or displaying a success message.
1. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for potential issues during form submission, such as network errors or server-side validation errors. Display appropriate error messages to the user and provide guidance on how to resolve the issue.

**Submission:** Provide a GitHub repository containing the source code of your web application.
